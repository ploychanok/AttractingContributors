# Attracting Contributors

As part of the Software Engineering Class, we would like to simulate how Open Source Projects start and try to attract potential contributions.

# My project: Anything within three words.

Goal: Type anything within three words. It can be in any language. For example, I love dog, ประยุทธ์ ออก ไป and にんじん が 嫌い.
Feel free! :blush:
